- [Polars 开公司啦](https://www.pola.rs/posts/company-announcement/)
  - We are excited to announce the start of company
    that will build around Polars, enabling
    data processing at any scale.
  - 有意思, 期待!

```
Polars is entirely based on Arrow data types and
backed by Arrow memory arrays.
This makes data processing cache-efficient and
well-supported for Inter Process Communication.

> For example, in floating point numbers `NaN != NaN`,
  so floating point types implement `PartialEq`
  but not `Eq`.

- If a type `T` implements `Default`, then the
  standard library implements `Default` automatically
  for `Rc<T>`, `Arc<T>`, `Box<T>`, `Cell<T>`,
  `RefCell<T>`, `Cow<T>`, `Mutex<T>`, and `RwLock<T>`.

  - 期待

```
Our goal is to stabilize the MVP for Rust 1.74,
which will be released on 2023-11-16.

So, once this MVP is done, what next?
Our next immediate goals are to ship
dynamic dispatch and async closures
support in 2024.

- [Generic associated types to be stable in Rust 1.65](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/10/28/gats-stabilization.html)

```
At its core, generic associated types allow you
to have generics (type, lifetime, or const)
on associated types.
```

```rust
trait LendingIterator {
  type Item<'a> where Self: 'a;

  fn next<'a>(&'a mut self) -> Self::Item<'a>;
}
```

- Traits with GATs are not object safe
